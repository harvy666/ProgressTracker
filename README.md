In this assignment you'll build a simple web application that might help
teams to track their progress during a project. You'll learn about agile
development later so let us summarize some concepts here:

- **User story description**: a natural language description/story from
  the perspective of a user of the system. Example: "As a \<persona\>, I
  want \<what?\> so that \<why?\>"
- **Acceptance Criteria**: a set of statements, each with a clear
  pass/fail result, that specify both functional and non-functional
  requirements.
- **Business value**: a numerical value to represent the importance of
  the User Story for the so called business (actually the customer).
- **Estimation**: Summary of the expected amount of work in all tasks
  collected to achieve User Story.
- **Status**: Current state of the User Story's development cycle.

Your system should be able to list, create, and update User Stories.
